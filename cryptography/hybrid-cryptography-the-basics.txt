Hybrid Cryptography is an approach used in many places 

1. Use a shared (symmetric - AES) key algorithm to encrypt the file 
2. Use public key (asymmetric) algorithm to encrypt the SHARED key [Recipient will provide the public key]
3. Recipient will use the private key to decrypt the symmetric key
4. Using the symmetric key, the data can be decrypted by the recipient
