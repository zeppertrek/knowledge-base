1. A digital signature should not be confused with a digital certificate

2. A digital signature can be used to validate the authenticity and integrity of data/information 
   [Sender's identity, that the message has not been tampered with, non repudiation]

3. The data that is being digitally signed does not have to be encrypted 

4. a. The sender will hash the data 
[HASH - Hashing refers to the concept of taking an arbitrary amount of input data, applying some algorithm to it, and generating a fixed-size output data called the hash.]

  b. The hash is encrypted with the sender's private key

  c. Data and the encrypted hash will be sent to the recipient

5. I have three suppliers - Each supplier will sign their digital deliveries using their own private key
   I will have the public keys of all three suppliers. Using this I can verify the digital signature
