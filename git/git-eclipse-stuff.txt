1. Starting from scratch
------------------------

>> create a repository (remote) on GITHUB (preferred, you can create the repository on any other server as well)
>> Clone this repository to your local machine
>> Ensure that the repository is created in the same folder that your eclipse project will use
>> Create the project in Eclipse
>> Add files to the Index
>> Commit 
>> Push Upstream

       1a. Coming back to the same project after many many months 
           The repository is on GitHub
           The project has been deleted from the local file system 
            -- Clone the repository once again and repeat the steps as described above


2. You have a local repository and this needs to get pushed into GITHUB (preferred, you can create the repository on any other server as well)
------------------------
>> Create the local repository
>> Commit your Eclipse project into it
>> Create repository in GITHUB

NOTE - Your local repository and the one on GITHUB do not have anything in common

>> git merge  <remote name>/master --allow_unrelated_histories
>> git push --set_upstream <remote name> master
