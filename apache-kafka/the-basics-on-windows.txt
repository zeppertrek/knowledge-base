1. Zookeeper - Standalone or the one bundled with Kafka
--------------------------------------------------------
Use the standalone one.
Set ZOOKEEPER_HOME and the Path
rename zoo_sample.cfg to zoo.cfg and modify the file (datadir setting)
### The work involved in using the standalone version over the bundled one is not really too much
Start Zookeeper (default port 2181)

2. Configuring and running Kafka
---------------------------------
Kafka must have a running Zookeeper instance 

modify server.properties file to set the log directory location 
From the Kafka installation directory run 
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

3. Verifying that your Kafka installation is actually up and running
---------------------------------------------------------------------
>> Create a topic [a key concept in Kafka]
kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic zeppertrekker
(Make sure that you are in the <<Kafka installation directory>>\bin\windows folder)

>> Produce and consume a message from the command line
Open two separate command line windows 

-- The producer from where one can post messages 
kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic zeppertrekker

--The consumer from where one actually sees the messages 
kafka-console-consumer.bat --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic zeppertrekker

{{For the consumer ignore "Using the ConsoleConsumer with old consumer is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Consider using the new consumer by passing [bootstrap-server] instead of [zookeeper].
this is message 1 from a zeppertrekker" }}
